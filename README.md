# 1. Two way binding in angular.js.
A change in the input text refreshes the view box as well.

This is done using three ways

1. native DOM @file, index-dom.html

2. jquery framework, index-jquery.html

3. angular framework, index-angular.html

# 2. Todo items application in angular.js
You will use angular's inbuilt directive, ng-repeat to display a list of items

You will use ng-click to add a new todo item to the list of todos

You will use ng-click to delete an item from the list as well

# 3. A cursory view of inbuilt angular directives
ng-show, ng-hide

ng-max, ng-min, ng-readonly, ng-disabled

# 4. Writing our own directive
First, we will see how to write a phone number input box using native DOM

Next, we will do the same work by building a custom angular directive and re-using it wherever we want.
